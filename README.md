# Github Trend Analyzer

A flask app that fetches and scrapes data from the github trending page and displays it sorted by star count. The user can clear previously collected data or continue to fetch more trending repositories whenever the github trending page is updated.

### How to use:

Clone the repo and install the required libraries:
```
git clone https://github.com/spencerboggs/github-trend-analyzer.git
cd github-trend-analyzer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the app:
```
python app.py
```

The development server will most likely start on http://localhost:5000, if not then check the terminal for the correct url.
